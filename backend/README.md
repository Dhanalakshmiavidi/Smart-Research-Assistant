# Smart Research Assistant Backend

This backend uses Node.js and Express. It exposes a sample health check endpoint at `/api/health`.

## Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```powershell
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```

## API Endpoints
- `GET /api/health`: Returns backend status.

## Next Steps
- Add more API endpoints as needed for your application.
- Connect the frontend to these endpoints using HTTP requests.
